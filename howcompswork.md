# How Computers Work

## What makes a computer, a computer

A computer is a tool that helps us with thinking work like equations. They manipulate information. The computer takes input, stores, processes, and then outputs results.

## How computers work; Binary and Data

Electric wires and circuits control the binary data in a computer. The signals are either on or off. aka 1 or 0. This is called a bit and is the smallest amount of data a computer can store. binary has 2 digits; 0 and 1. Videos and sounds are also stored as bits in binary.

## How computers work; circuits and logic

Circuits can modify the electric currents to give you different numbers, 1 or 0 by turning on or off. they can be, and, xor, adder, and not. These circuits have gotten smaller and smaller over the years. Smaller circuits are faster because it takes less time for the electricity to get to each circuit.

## How computers work; cpu, memory, input and output

Input converts physical input to binary information. Memory store info, and cpu calculates info. Output devices take the info and convert it into something we can use, like a picture. Input can be sensors, or a keyboard or almost anything.

## how computers work; Hardware and Software

Software is all of the programs on the computer. CPU has different circuits to do different things. It receives simple commands to know what circuit it needs to do. These simple commands are in fact software. The operating system manages everything on the computer and controls the cpu to tell it which programs to run and when.
