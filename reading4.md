## Headers and Footers

The `<header>` and `<footer>` tags are used at the top and bottom of a page, respectively. The header has the site name and main navigation while the footer has copyright info.

The `<nav>` tag is used for the navigation section of the site. This is where links to other pages on the site will be.

## Articles

The `<aritcle>` tag acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone. ie. blog, news article, forum post. There can be several article elements and they can be nested inside each other as well.

## Asides

The `<aside>` tag has two purposes depending on whether or not it is used inside or outside an article element.

### Inside

When inside, it should contain info that is related to the article but not essential to the overall meaning.

### Outside

When outside, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page.

## Sections

The `<section>` tag is used to group related content together. This is done using classes for each separate tag.

## Heading Groups

The purpose of the `<hgroup>` tag groups a set of one or more `<h1>` through `<h6>` tags together to be treated as a single heading.

## Figures

The `<figure>` tag is used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article. it is important the article still functions without this piece in it. A `<figcaption>` tag should also be used to provide context.

## Sectioning Elements
