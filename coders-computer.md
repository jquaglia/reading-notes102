# The Coder's Computer

## Choosing a Text Editor

Choosing a text editor is a very personal choice as almost any text editor can be used. Not all editors are the same, however. The editors that already come with your computer are usually very basic compared to thrid-party selections. The two main default ones that computers come with are:

- Text Edit (Mac)
- Notepad (Windows)
- (Different Linux distros come with different editors)

You can get the job done with these, however, they don't have many features and creature comforts that come with the third-party editors. Some of the more popular editors are:

- Notepad++
- BB Edit
- VS Code
- Atom
- Brackets
- Sublime Text

Some of the features that these editors have will make your coding more enjoyable. Some of the popular features include:

- syntax highlighting (makes code more readable/noticeable by coloring text e.g. attributes are a different color than elements which are different than copy)
- themes (can reduce eye-strain, and they're fun)
- extensions (can add support for new languages among other things)
- code completion (will predict what code you are typing like tab to comlete file path)

So as you can see, these features are just a few of the things that will help you write code more efficiently and while making it more enjoyable as well. This is important because we as humans tend to get more things done when we enjoy it.

## The Command Line

The command line is a text based version of the file explorer GUI(Graphical User Interface) that everyone who's used a computer has used. The difference is that the command line or terminal uses text commands to do the things you would normally do. It's a more succinct way of telling the computer exactly what you want it to do. Because of how succinct it is, there are many more things you can do in a command line that would take much longer in the GUI.
