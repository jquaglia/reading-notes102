# The Terminal

- The terminal is a text based interface as opposed to the GUI.
- Starts off with a prompt. 
- The next thing entered is a command. 
- You can attach options/arguments to the command. 
- Options modify the behaviour of the command. 
- You will either see the output or the command will just do the task without letting you know. (unless an error pops up) 
- Once the prompt pops up again, you know the task has been completed.
- shell defines how terminal will behave and look while using commands
- bash is the most common (bourne again shell)
- path is the means to get to a certain file or directory (everything comes from root directory)
- relative path can produce different results depending where you are (can save time)
- absolute path will be the desired result 
- use quotes for files with space in the name
- hidden files begin with `.`

## Commands
- pwd stands for print working directory, can be used to see where you are in files
- ls `[options][location]` is used to list whats in a directory
- cd `[location]` is used to change directories, takes you to home directory if used without location
- `\` escape character nullifies the special meaning of next character
- ls -a lists all contents of directory, even hidden files

### Shortcuts
- push the up arrow to see previous commands
- `~` is shortcut for root directory
- `.` is shortcut for your current directory
- `..` is shortcut for the parent directory
- tab completion for paths and commands
- tab completion works before the space in directory name with an escape character
