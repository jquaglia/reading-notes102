# The Terminal

- The terminal is a text based interface as opposed to the GUI.
- Starts off with a prompt. 
- The next thing entered is a command. 
- You can attach options/arguments to the command. 
- Options modify the behaviour of the command. 
- You will either see the output or the command will just do the task without letting you know. (unless an error pops up) 
- Once the prompt pops up again, you know the task has been completed.
- shell defines how terminal will behave and look while using commands
- bash is the most common (bourne again shell)
