## The Growth Mindset

The growth mindset to me is present in every day life. Instead of saying "I can't do something", you need to say "I don't know how to do this yet." Saying "I can't" implies that you will never try to do the thing. Saying "I don't know how" is a more open ended statement with room for growth. It could be something as simple as parallel parking. If you never try and fail to do it, you will never learn the right way. In a way it's all about perception. How you perceive the challenges and things around you is how you will choose to interact with them. For instance, you want to ski black diamond runs, but get disheartened by seeing younger kids skiing them better than you. What you're failing to consider is that they might still have more experience than you despite your age.


### Some tips for staying in the growth mindset

- failure is necessary
- ~~I can't~~ **I don't know how yet**
- parallel parking
