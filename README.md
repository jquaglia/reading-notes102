## Jason Quaglia

I'm a 26 year old student at CodeFellows. I live in downtown Seattle with my girlfriend and our dog Bentley. Some of the things I like to do in my free time are gaming, hiking, camping, snowboarding, and of course I love tinkering with computers and technology. I'm hoping to become a software engineer to better myself and my life. I've always loved computers and technology and hope to bring some of that passion into a career. Hopefully, with the help of CodeFellows I can make that come to fruition.
