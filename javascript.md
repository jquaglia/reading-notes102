## How to use Objects and Methods

`document.write('Good afternoon!');` "document" is the object which represents the entire web page. All web browsers implement this object. The "." is the member operator. The _document_ object has several methods and properties. They are known **members** of that object. You can access thee members by using a dot in between the object name and the member you want to access. `write('Good afternoon!');` is the method. the _write_ method of the _document_ object allows new content to be written into the page where the `<script>` element sits. `'Good afternoon!'` are the parameters. Whenever a method requires some information in order to work, the data is given inside the parenthesis.

### JS runs where it is found in the HTML

## Basic JS Instructions

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one by one. Each individual instruction is known as a statement. Statements end with a semicolon.

## Variables

`var quantity;` The var is the variable keyword (use `let` more now) and the quantity is the variable name. `quantity = 3;`  "`=`" is the assignment operator, 3 is the variable value. It is possible to use a variable to store a number or string for later use.

### Rules for naming a Variable

1. the name must begin with a letter, dollar sign, or an underscore. It must not start with a number

1. the name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign or an underscore. do not use a . or a -

1. you cannot use keywords or reserved words

1. all variables are case sensitive so _score_ and _Score_ would be different variables.

1. Use a name that describes what info the variable stores

1. if your variable name is made up of more than 1 word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word ie `lastName`
