## How to use Objects and Methods

`document.write('Good afternoon!');` "document" is the object which represents the entire web page. All web browsers implement this object. The "." is the member operator. The _document_ object has several methods and properties. They are known **members** of that object. You can access thee members by using a dot in between the object name and the member you want to access. `write('Good afternoon!');` is the method. the _write_ method of the _document_ object allows new content to be written into the page where the `<script>` element sits. `'Good afternoon!'` are the parameters. Whenever a method requires some information in order to work, the data is given inside the parenthesis.
